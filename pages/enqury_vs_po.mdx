# 📄 Enquiry vs Purchase Order (PO)

Understanding the difference between an **Enquiry** and a **Purchase Order (PO)** is essential for new joiners and business growth partners at **OBAOL Supreme**. This guide walks you through each concept and how to convert interest into action.

---

## 🔍 What Is an Enquiry?

An **Enquiry** is a buyer’s **expression of interest**. It’s an early-stage interaction where the buyer seeks information — not a commitment.

### Examples:

- “Do you have 5 tons of Salem turmeric?”
- “What’s the rate for 8mm cardamom today?”
- “Can you source cloves from Tamil Nadu?”

### Key Points:

- ❌ Not a confirmation
- 🧠 Buyer may be checking multiple sources
- 📊 They’re exploring: price, availability, timeline, supplier credibility

**✅ Your Role:**

- Qualify the enquiry
- Check for buyer authenticity
- Understand the buyer's actual need

---

## 📄 What Is a Purchase Order (PO)?

A **PO (Purchase Order)** is a formal confirmation that the buyer wants to proceed with the trade.

### It Includes:

- ✅ Product details
- ✅ Quantity and price
- ✅ Agreed payment terms
- ✅ Delivery expectations

> **Note:** A PO ≠ Payment. It’s a commitment, but **further steps are still required** for execution (e.g., dispatch, payment confirmation, invoicing).

## ⚖️ Enquiry vs PO: The Difference

| Aspect           | Enquiry                        | Purchase Order (PO)              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Nature           | Interest / Information-seeking | Confirmation / Commitment        |
| Stage            | Pre-negotiation                | Post-negotiation                 |
| Detail Level     | Often vague or exploratory     | Specific: quantity, rate, terms  |
| Guarantee        | No guarantee of sale           | Strong intent to proceed         |
| Formality        | Informal                       | Formal (even if over chat/email) |
| Risk of Dropping | High                           | Lower, but still possible        |

## 🎯 Not Every Enquiry Converts to a PO

In agro trading, many enquiries do **not** convert into POs.

### Common Reasons:

- Price mismatch
- Product unavailable
- Buyer was only comparing
- Lack of trust or credibility
- Poor communication or over-selling

✅ **Your job:** Maximize conversions by managing the interaction with professionalism.
