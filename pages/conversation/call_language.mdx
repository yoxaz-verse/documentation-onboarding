## Narrative & Call Language

When speaking live:

- **Avoid filler words**: “uh,” “just,” “I think.” Use silence instead.
- **Use affirming intros**:
  - “Here’s how we ensure every lead is authenticated…”
  - “Let me walk you through our proven price-discovery engine…”

**Ask outcome-driven questions**:

- “How are you currently tracking your daily cardamom quotes?”
- “What would a 10% uptick in sale price mean for your seasonal revenue?”

**Transition to value**:

- “With real-time notifications, you’ll never miss price spikes—giving you peace of mind and higher returns.”

**Close clearly**:

- “I’ll send your onboarding link by 5 PM IST today. Complete verification by tomorrow, and get your first live feed by 6 AM IST.”

Use this formula:

**Question → Value → Proof → Next Step**
