## The Big Picture: Tone, Structure & Focus

Every sentence in your outreach should:

- **Address a pain point**: unreliable pricing, fraud, visibility.
- **Show empathy**: _"I know how frustrating it is…"_
- **Offer a solution**: _"Live-feed rates eliminate guesswork."_
- **Build trust**: verified users, encrypted data, audit trail.
- **Guide action**: demo, trial, signup, or call.

**Writing style tips:**

- Sentences: 10–15 words
- Voice: Active
- Focus: Customer-first (_“You’ll save…” not “We offer…”_)
