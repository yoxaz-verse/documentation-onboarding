### 🎯 Role Summary

The **BDA** bridges the gap between **Research** and **Deal Closure**.  
You will take **qualified leads** from the **Research Specialist (RS)** team, verify their details, and engage in **intent-based conversations** until they are ready for handover to the **Relationship Partner (RP)**.

Every interaction should reinforce our mission:

> **Building standardized trade in India — ensuring fair, transparent, and efficient sourcing practices across the supply chain.**

⚡ **Important:**

- The call is **not a pitch**.
- Your goal is to **verify RS data, confirm intent, and guide the conversation toward the real need.**
- If you feel the RS-identified intent is wrong, **shift the conversation naturally to the correct intent.**
- Help prospects understand **how they benefit by being early members in OBAOL**, gaining free access to a new, trusted opportunity in agro trade.

### 📌 Core Responsibilities

1. 📥 Receive qualified leads from RS and **verify all details** before contact.
2. 📞 Contact leads **within 24 hours**.
3. 🔍 **Validate information & confirm intent** — correct if necessary.
4. 🌱 Have **intent-based conversations** (not sales pitches).
5. 🗣 Explain **early benefits** of OBAOL membership (completely free).
6. 📊 Score leads for **fit, interest, urgency**.
7. 📢 Share **market intelligence & feedback** with RS and management.

---

### 🔄 Workflow

#### **Step 1 – Study the Lead Before Contact**

- Review **all RS details**:

  - Company name & address
  - Contact number
  - Email ID
  - Decision-maker name
  - Assumed **product & quality requirements**
  - General & specific intent (verify and correct if needed)

- **Study the product** before calling:

  - Use the **dedicated product study page** in this guide (includes drive links with detailed product notes).
  - Supplement with **online research** (market trends, pricing, demand, challenges).
  - Be prepared with product-specific talking points and questions.

- **Understand the intent** noted by RS and prepare validation questions.
- Prepare **talking points & outreach plan** before contact.

---

#### **Step 2 – Initial Outreach**

**Contact within 24 hours** via:

1. 📞 Call
2. 💬 WhatsApp
3. 📧 Email

Goals:

- **Verify RS data** (contact, intent, company info, product/quality).
- Engage in a **natural, intent-driven conversation**.
- If RS intent is wrong, **shift the conversation** to the correct one.
- Position OBAOL as:
  - A **trusted trade partner**
  - An **exclusive, free, one-time opportunity**
  - An **extended sales team** working with them

📌 **Mandatory Action:**  
Once you have successfully connected with a prospect (call answered, conversation started), submit the details using the **BDA Entry Form**:  
👉 [BDA Entry Form – Submit Connection Details](https://forms.gle/naaFJAP5cZ4S1Qrz7)

This ensures that:

- Every connection is documented
- Management and RP teams stay updated
- Lead tracking remains transparent and accountable

---

#### **Step 3 – Qualification Deep-Dive (Intent & Readiness Check)**

Confirm:

- 🧑‍💼 **Decision-maker / authorized contact** — confirm who will take the RP call (name, role, best contact). If the person you reach isn't the decision-maker, capture the correct contact and next steps.
- 📦 **Product & quality assumptions** — verify the assumed product, grade/specs, pack size and any sample/quality requirements (note any differences vs RS data).
- 🎯 **Real intent & urgency** — classify intent as one of: **Exploratory / Interested / Ready-to-engage** (use 1–5 scale to capture seriousness).
- 🧩 **Fit with OBAOL value** — check if the prospect sees benefit in an **exclusive, free, one-time** RP connection and extended-sales-team support.
- 🤝 **Readiness for 1:1 RP connection** — confirm willingness to accept a dedicated point-of-contact and join a short RP introduction call.
- 📂 **Drive data & supporting documents** — confirm whether the drive data / documents needed for further research were provided. If missing, escalate to management immediately so they can act.
- 🛑 **Objections & constraints** — capture any blockers, approvals required, or special conditions to note for RP.
- 🔁 **Changes vs RS data** — explicitly record any corrections to company, contact, product, or intent so RS/CRM is updated.

Quick checklist (before handover):

- ✅ Decision-maker identified or path to decision-maker recorded
- ✅ Product/specs validated or corrected
- ✅ Intent rating recorded (1–5) and labeled Exploratory/Interested/Ready
- ✅ Prospect accepts/understands the value of a dedicated RP contact
- ✅ Drive data present OR escalation raised to management
- ✅ Key objections documented and next steps agreed

Suggested short questions to use on the call:

- “Are you the person who makes (or influences) decisions for this product? If not, who should we speak to?”
- “We have [product X, quality Y] listed — is that correct? Any change in spec/pack/grade?”
- “On a scale of 1–5, how ready are you to engage with a dedicated Relationship Partner?”
- “Would you be open to a short joint intro call with our RP who will act as your single point of contact?”
- “Do you have the supporting drive files/documents we need? If not, I will escalate this so management can act quickly.”

Notes for BDAs:

- This conversation is **validation + readiness**, not a sales pitch. Lead the call with questions, listen actively, and update records immediately if anything changes.
- If the RS-intent is incorrect, **shift the conversation naturally** to the correct intent and record the change.
- Only pass to RP when the prospect confirms readiness for a 1:1 connection and the checklist above is satisfied.

---

#### **Step 4 – Warm-Up Process**

- Share **brochures, product lists, case studies**
- Provide **market insights & trends**
- Maintain **consistent, value-driven follow-ups** until RP-ready

---

#### **Step 5 – Lead Scoring**

**A. Lead Scoring Factors**

1. Fit (0–5) → Target profile match
2. Interest (0–5) → Engagement level
3. Timeline (0–5) → Buying timeframe

**Total Score = Fit + Interest + Timeline** (Max: 15)

**B. Scoring Actions:**

- 🔥 **12–15 (Hot):** Pass to RP immediately
- 🌤 **8–11 (Warm):** Keep nurturing
- ❄️ **0–7 (Cold):** Archive for future follow-up

---

#### **Step 6 – Handover to RP**

The transition from BDA → RP is critical. This is not just a lead transfer, it is the **moment we assign a dedicated point of contact** from our team to the associate.

Your role is to **prepare the company for this one-to-one connection** by making sure they are truly ready.

When passing a lead to the RP, always emphasize:

- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Dedicated Point of Contact** – The RP will be their single trusted contact inside OBAOL.
- 🤝 **Bond of Trust** – This step builds long-term reliability with our associates.
- 🎯 **Exclusive & Free** – This is a **completely exclusive, one-time opportunity**, not something “cheap” or easily obtained.
- 🛠 **Extended Sales Team** – Position OBAOL as their **extended sales team**, working alongside them to grow their trade.

**Checklist before handover:**

- ✅ Verified RS data + confirmed product/quality details
- ✅ Confirmed real intent (not just assumed)
- ✅ Prospect understands the value of a dedicated contact
- ✅ Prospect is open to a long-term trust-based relationship

**Include in Handover Package to RP:**

- Lead score
- All contact & requirement details
- Conversation summary (including objections, product insights, intent corrections)
- Indication of readiness for 1:1 RP connection
- If possible, arrange a **joint BDA–RP–client introduction call** to reinforce trust

#### **Step 7 – Feedback Loop**

- Follow up with RP on progress
- Share **market & intent corrections** with RS
