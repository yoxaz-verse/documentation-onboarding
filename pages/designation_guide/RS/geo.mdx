## 🌍 Understanding GEO — Generative Engine Optimization

**GEO** stands for **Generative Engine Optimization** — the process of optimizing your content so it appears in answers provided by **AI-powered search tools** like **ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, or Perplexity AI**.

Where **SEO** is about ranking high on Google’s **blue link results**,  
**GEO** is about becoming part of the **AI-generated answers** people get when they ask a question.

---

### 📌 Why GEO Matters

The internet is changing:

- People aren’t just **searching** anymore — they’re **asking** AI tools for answers.
- Instead of giving a list of websites, AI **summarizes** the answer and sometimes mentions sources.
- If your brand is in that answer, you can get **huge visibility** — even if you never rank #1 on Google.

💡 _Think of GEO as teaching AI to “talk about you” when people ask about your industry._

---

### 🤖 How Generative Search Works

When you ask a tool like ChatGPT or Perplexity:

1. It searches its **training data** (and sometimes live web data).
2. It finds **trusted, relevant sources**.
3. It **summarizes** that information into a natural conversation.
4. If your content is **clear, well-structured, and trustworthy**, AI may quote or link to you.
