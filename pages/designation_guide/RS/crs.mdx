### 🎯 Role Objective

The **CRS** ensures that every lead passed to the sales team is **complete, validated, and worth pursuing**.

This role is **100% research-focused**:

- **No calling**
- **No selling**
- **No direct prospect engagement**

Instead, CRS is responsible for:

- **Data validation**
- **Lead qualification**
- **Accurate documentation for BDAs**

---

### 📌 Core Responsibilities

#### **1. Strategic Data Validation**

- Work on data sets provided directly by the **management team**
- Research and verify exporters, suppliers, and key stakeholders in the Indian agro-industry
- Confirm all **mandatory fields** for every lead:

  - ✅ **Company Name** 🏢
  - ✅ **Verified contact number** 📞
  - ✅ **Verified company address** 📍

- Apply the **Five-Point Qualification Criteria**:

  1. General Intent
  2. Specific Intent
  3. Pain Point
  4. Stage (Awareness → Decision)
  5. Role of the Company

- **Only submit** fully validated leads via the research form for BDAs to access.

### 🛠 Standard Operating Workflow (CRS)

1. 📥 **Receive Lead Data** – Data sets are provided by the management team.  
   👉 Submit/receive through this form: [Research Data Form](https://forms.gle/UrgSaXsiR6voX8bj9)  
   📌 _If the drive data required for research is missing, contact the management team immediately for quick action._

2. 🗑 **Initial Screening** – Remove duplicates, outdated, or irrelevant contacts.

3. 📌 **Mandatory Field Check** – Make sure **all fields in the form are properly filled**.

   - Some fields will be easy to find, others harder.
   - Do not leave fields blank — put effort into completing each one.

4. 📊 **Five-Point Qualification** – Intent is critical since **BDAs base conversations on it**. Ensure intent and stage are assessed carefully.

5. 📝 **Submit Validated Leads via Form** – Your role is to fill the research form clearly and completely.

   - Data should be **structured, accurate, and easy for BDAs to understand**.
   - BDAs will use this form data directly for conversations — CRS does **not** contact them directly.

6. 📊 **Daily Reporting** – Update the team on:

   - ✅ Number of leads completed each day
   - ✅ Progress on datasets

7. 💬 **Stay Active on Zoho Cliq** – Always be responsive and available to coordinate with the team.

### ⭐ Golden Rules for CRS

1. **Validate before submitting** — never send incomplete or unverified info.
2. **Be thorough** — even difficult fields must be filled, no shortcuts.
3. **Intent is king** — BDAs depend on it for conversations.
4. **Keep form data clear** — structured entries make BDA calls easier.
5. **Stay accountable** — daily reporting is mandatory.
6. **Be responsive** — stay active and engaged on Cliq at all times.

📌 **Key Takeaway:**  
The CRS ensures that **every lead is complete, validated, and intent-ready** by submitting accurate data in the form — so BDAs can confidently pick it up and build trust in their conversations.
